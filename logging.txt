

Five types of log labelling we have in python

1. info    --> generic like print
2. Debug
3. warning
4. Error
5. Critical

info:
	It is generic like print
	
	eg. import logging
		logging.basicConfig(filename='test.log', level=logging.info)
		logging.info('This is my very first logging code')
	
Debug:
	It is used for investigating code

logging.debug('This is a debug message')
logging.warning("This is a warning message")
logging.error("This is a error message")
logging.critical("This is a critical message")

Numbering system(severity level):
	Debug - 10
	info - 20
	waring - 30
	error - 40
	critical - 50

logging.basicConfig(filename='example.log', level=logging.DEBUG, format='%(levelname)s %(asctime)s %(name)s : %(message)s')

try:
	logging.info('Trying to read the file')
    with open("karthik.txt", "r"):
		logging.info('reading the file successfully completed')
except Exception as e:
	logging.exception(e)
